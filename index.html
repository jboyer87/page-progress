		<h1>Page-Progress</h1>
		
		<em>Because some pages are <strong>long!</strong></em>	
		<p><b>Page Progress</b> is a simple jQuery reading progress line. When included on a page, a progress bar will appear along the edge of the browser window to let the reader know how far they have progressed through a page.</p>

		<h2>Features</h2>
		
		<p><b>Save your place</b> -- As the user scrolls, progress is tracked in pixels and the URL is updated on each scroll event to include the offset from the top of the page. When a page is bookmarked, or linked to, <b>Page Progress</b> uses the value in the URL and automatically scrolls to that point. Give it a try by opening <a target="_blank" href="index.html#500">this page in a new window</a>.</p>

		<h2>Usage</h2>
		
		<p>To use Page Progress, include <b>jQuery</b>, <b>page-progress.min.js</b>, and <b>page-progress.min.css</b> on your page, and you're ready to go.</p>

		<h3>Customization</h3>
		
		<p>Customize the <strong>page-progress.css</strong> file to change the look and feel of the progress bar:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>.ppProgressBarContainer</code> is the container for the progress bar:
				<ul>
					<li>The background for the unfilled portion of the progress bar  is a transparent gray by default -- Change the <code>background-color</code> property to adjust.</li>
					<li>The height is set to <code>1em</code> by default. Change <code>height</code> to adjust.</li>
					<li>Page Progress attaches to the top of the browser window. Change the <code>top</code> property to <code>bottom</code> to adjust. Change the value for <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code> to use an offset for compatibility with floating/sticky headers.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>.ppProgressBar</code> is the actual progress bar itself:
				<ul>
					<li>Modify the <code>background-color</code> property to change the color of the progress bar.</li>
					<li>The <code>min-width</code> property can be altered to change the smallest possible width of the progress bar.</li>
					<li>Change the <code>height</code> value to adjust the progress bar's height. This should correspond with the <code>height</code> property for <code>.ppProgressBarContainer</code>.</li>
					<li><code>width</code> is set to allow for an animation on page load. Remove the <code>width</code> and <code>min-width</code> properties to get rid of this.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Configuration</h3>

		<p>Modify the page-progress.js file to turn the bookmark function on or off:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Simply remove lines 15-19 and lines 22-28 to remove the bookmark function. They are clearly marked with <code>Bookmark function</code></p></li>	
		</ul>

		<p>The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.</p>
		<p>Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.</p>
		<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
		<p>To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</p>
		<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
		<p>If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.</p>
		<p>Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p>
		<p>Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.</p>
		<p>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.</p>
		<p>I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine</p>
		<p>We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other</p>
		<p>Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p>
		<p>Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.</p>
		<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
		<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
		<p>Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.</p>
		<p>NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.</p>
		<p>The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!</p>

		<p>You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.</p>
		<p>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</p>
		<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
		<p>We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.</p>
		<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
