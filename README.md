# Page-Progress

[Demo]<http://www.jamesjboyer.com/projects/page-progress>

**Page Progress** is a simple jQuery reading progress line. When included on a page, a progress bar will appear along the edge of the browser window to let the reader know how far they have progressed through an article.

##Features

**Save your place** -- As the user scrolls, progress is tracked in pixels and the URL is updated on each scroll event to include the offset from the top of the page. When a page is bookmarked, or linked to, **Page Progress** uses the value in the URL and automatically scrolls to that point.
